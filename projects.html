        <p class="lead">Project Looking Glass is a software architecture designed to allow for the implementation of a 
            multiple layered, scale less Artificial Intelligence. This artificially developed intelligent system is 
            inspired by the structure and function of the human Prefrontal Cortex and Frontal Eye Field. An implemented 
            AI on the architecture will serve as the main controller for a number of other projects in development by 
            Valhalla. Despite sounding arcane and complex, this system has applications in Alzheimer's treatment, war 
            gaming, enhanced learning and bureaucracy management.
            <br/><br/>
            For example, in Alzheimer's Treatment, the AI developed by Looking Glass would be incorporate into a Smart 
            Phone, or other Personal Organizer. The patient would have a brief training period in concert with his or 
            her caregivers, on how to interact with the AI and catalogue various important memories and events. The idea
            here is to augment the hippocampus. The system would gradually learn which were important or significant 
            memories and also find when memories or associations are not made by the user. The AI, seeing a breakdown 
            in the connections, then looks to reroute the memory/association through other memories or inputs, by 
            interacting with the patient. Once it finds a new connection, it then helps the patient retrain that memory 
            using other resources in their own mind. in this way, having a full time, analytic cognitive partner will 
            force the neural plasticity mechanism in the mind to rebuild and reinforce the lost connections.
            <br/><br/>
            This is just one way that a system like the Project Looking Glass AI could be implemented in improving the 
            day to day lives of people in need.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Seed Factory <!--span class="muted">See for yourself.</span--></h2>
        <p class="lead">Project Seed Factory is a self-replicating, autonomous system capable of gathering and 
            processing raw and recycled material in order to facilitate the overall goal of autonomous continued 
            function for the "seed factory." Being a self-replicating system that is responsible for its materials 
            procurement and processing, it can perpetuate and maintain itself.
            <br/><br/>
            How is that useful? Good question. The idea of this kind of "factory" is to utilize the materials on hand to 
            create new goods or materials. A simple, real world application of this is in the field of profitable 
            recycling. 'Bots could be fabricated from available materials, using 3-D printing and other rapid automated 
            fabrication. Those 'bots go into the area, to collect refuse of the relevant materials type. Those materials 
            are then recycled into more 'bots, until the environment is considered "clean."
            <br/><br/>
            That's just one, simple application of the system, which would be driven by the Looking Glass AI.
            <br/><br/>
            The establishment of the project was spurred on after the team saw huge volumes of discarded waste, 
            containers, and other foreign refuse on the way back from a kayaking expedition. It was noted that the road 
            contains numerous scenic opportunities, disturbed visually by the trash that is strewn alongside it. Since 
            the road is far from normal residential areas and the potential for human workers to intervene (in terms of 
            both manpower or support reach), it was then thought that these things can be accomplished by means of 
            drones to process them to something usable.

        <p class="lead">Famine should simply no longer be a problem.
            <br/><br/>
            In an age when circumnavigating the globe can happen within a day's time, when telecommunications and 
            computing are easily and cheaply accessible to the First World, it seems unreasonable that people are 
            starving from factors that simply shouldn't be relevant any longer. With applied science, geography and 
            climate are no longer limiting factors in farming and raising food. Let's shift the conversation from 
            charities that ship food to the needy, as they don't solve the problem and only treat a symptom.
            <br/><br/>
            Project Yggdrasil provides the ability to farm in climates and environments that are inhospitable to 
            traditional farming methods. Instead of providing a flow of foodstuffs from one location to another, 
            Yggdrasil, through a pre-packaged aquaponics unit, brings the ability to continuously raise produce and fish 
            to places with severe drought and unusable soil. In short, the solar-powered unit could be set up in 
            Ethiopia to generate food that the local environment no longer can. Easily operated by locals, this 
            consumer-grade product has yields similar to, if not better than, traditional farming methods, with 
            around-the-clock growing time. The aquaponics unit not only brings food to starving people, but also 
            independence since communities can be taught to run and maintain the system themselves.
            <br/><br/>
            The goal of the project is simple: "Feed everyone, everywhere, in every environment."
            <br/><br/>
            The science is currently accessible and being used. Project Yggdrasil brings this science to those that need 
            it most. Join us, and lend your support, in making this happen</p>
