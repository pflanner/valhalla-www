        <h2 class="featurette-heading">About Valhalla <!--span class="muted">It'll blow your mind.</span--></h2>
        <p class="lead">Valhalla Research and Development was conceived as a "think tank" style organization with the
            idea of bringing together intellectuals with diverse backgrounds to address real world problems. Valhalla
            will address these problems by developing technical solutions that incorporate innovative ways of
            integrating resources and technology to benefit the average person rather than corporations.
            <br/><br/>
            Too often, the field of technology grows in a direction determined by the free market. The "invisible hand"
            of the economy often governs solutions, which can result in failing to solve the actual problem or only
            solving the problems that are profitable. Valhalla was envisioned as a response to that mentality. It is a
            technical solutions group that is not ruled by economic force, but rather humanistic demands.
            <br/><br/>
            It could be asserted that if "humanistic demands" were really so prevalent, a for-profit company could turn
            a profit from meeting that demand. If that were true, the Law of Congestion would have already been applied
            to traffic management algorithms in a dynamic fashion, and you, the end user of streets and freeways, would
            be in bumper-to-bumper traffic far less often. The existing technology is good enough, and even though a
            demand exists to improve traffic technologies, there isn't a financially-driven demand. It's a small
            "quality of life" demand that we all take for granted. And that is just a minor example.
            <br/><br/>
            From recycling to prosthetics, from the mind-brain interface of technology to more efficient systems
            management, there are volumes of "problems" in the modern world that have novel solutions. Some are high
            tech, some are unique uses of off-the-shelf products, and still others are startlingly "low tech," but
            involve a radical paradigm shift in thought. The intention of bringing that sort of Promethean Fire to
            problem solving, without being slave to the balance sheet, is where Valhalla was born.</p>
