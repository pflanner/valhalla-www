        <h2 class="member-heading">Scott Renkes &#8211; Chairman of the Board, CEO<!--span class="muted">It'll blow your mind.</span--></h2>
        <p class="lead">As a circus performer and engineer, Scott brings a unique perspective to problem solving. Using 
            his diverse experiences and an interdisciplinary approach, Scott strives to develop technological solutions 
            based on human and environmental needs instead of profit-driven market forces. Always thinking creatively 
            about problems and solutions, Scott quit his job in the defense industry and joined forces with several 
            skilled colleagues in order to improve the way people live.</p>

        <h2 class="member-heading">Benjamin Hua &#8211; Board Member, Chief Engineer<!--span class="muted">It'll blow your mind.</span--></h2>
        <p class="lead">Working in the areas of engineering and industrial design, Ben places importance on function 
            first; form interworked back and forth, for solutions that augment human life with technology, both 
            cognitive and kinetic. Ben lives by the principle that solutions should not be barred by exclusivity of 
            intellectual use, which works well with Valhalla's mission. Ben brings along experience as an electrical 
            engineer, manufacturing experiences in woodworking, and understanding of the human body through acrobatic 
            arts.</p>

        <h2 class="member-heading">Adam Kuppersmith &#8211; Board Member, Public Relations<!--span class="muted">It'll blow your mind.</span--></h2>
        <p class="lead">As an educator in Southern California, Adam brings a unique perspective to artificial 
            intelligence design, as well as a "hands on" view to the real needs of technology in America. Having taught 
            only in South Central, Adam is painfully aware that the technologies and solutions available to the middle 
            class are simply not available to everyone. In his role in public relations for Valhalla, he seeks to bridge 
            this gap.</p>

        <p class="lead">David's experience as a senior architect and engineer provides a font of knowledge about 
            infrastructure development. This knowledge is used in the design of the Seed Factory, and his small business 
            experience has helped grow our organization. David's business management experience keenly drives Valhalla's 
            operations.</p>

        <p class="lead">Troy has always been one to push buttons and take things apart. Over the last few years, he has 
            developed a love for microcontrollers, do-it-yourself electronics, and has become enchanted with the Open 
            Source and Maker communities. Fueled by copious amounts of coffee and a creative drive, he thrives on 
            finding out-of-the-box solutions to problems.</p>

            in the summer of 2014. Through his experience, he hopes to gain a better understanding of what it is like to
